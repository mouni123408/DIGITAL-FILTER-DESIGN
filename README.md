INTERN ID:CT04DF431

DOMAIN:VLSI

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:

This task involves the design and simulation of a Finite impulse response digital filter,which is a type of linear digital filter commonly used in signal processing to remove noise or extract specific frequency components from a signal.The implementation can be done using either verilog,for hardware-based simulation and synthesis,or MATLAB,for software-based design and analysis.
This task provide practical experience in digita filter design,signal analysis,and verification of digital system using simulation tools.
